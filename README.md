# Digital Project 360º <br> Landing Page for Marques Soares + 

## Digital Project 360º

It's the final module common to all [EDIT.](https://edit.com.pt/)'s Courses, where students from different courses (Digital Marketing & Strategy, Digital Account & Project Management, Digital Art Direction & Creativity, UX & UI Design, Digital Product Design and Front-end Development) are distributed across different teams to jointly find and develop a solution for a given challenge launched by a benchmark. This way they not only have the opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary team environment, but also put into practice the knowledge acquired throughout the previous course modules. 

## Challenge

At the final module of EDIT.'s [Front-end Development Course](https://edit.com.pt/formacao/curso-frontend-development-porto/), in the ambit of Digital Project 360º, we teamed up with students of other EDIT's Courses to respond to the challenge launched by [Marques Soares](https://www.marquessoares.pt/) brand: Relaunch of the current account customer card, now under the name "Marques Soares +", highlighting its benefits and increasing the number of customers.

## My Role

As a member of team 5, with background in digital arts and communication design, in addition to the recent knowledge gained in the Front-end Development Course, I was involved in the creative process since the beginning and I was responsible for the front-end development of the digital campaign's Landing Page, being my front-end development colleague in charge of the membership form page's development.
With an attitude of mutual help, in addition to fulfilling my role as front-end developer, I actively participated in the research, concept and strategy definition, campaign claim definition, moodboard, and helped in the creation of some textual content and in the interface design of some elements for the Landing Page.
